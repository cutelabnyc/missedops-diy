# Missed Ops DIY Kit Instructions

Hi and thanks for buying the Missed Ops DIY kit. Here's how you build it.

## 1. Get the base board and the pin sockets

The base board is the one with Missed Opportunities written on it.

## 2. Start by soldering the two outer pin sockets

You only need to solder one pin on each for now, to hold everything in place.

## 3. Solder the four inner pin sockets

Again, for now you only need to solder the inner pins. Make sure the plastic of the sockets is flush with the PCB.

## 4. Put the seven 3-pin headers into the pin sockets

Make sure to insert the longer side of the header, so the shorter side sticks out.

## 5. Align the top board and slide the corresponding pins through the board holes

## 6. Solder the remaining pins on the base board, as well as the pins on the top board

## 7. Separate the boards

## 8. Insert the potentiometer and solder it in place

## 9. Solder the jumper header and the power header

## 10. (Optional) Solder the ISP headers.

The Atmega on your board comes preprogrammed, so you only need these pins if you want to upload your own firmware.

## 11. Insert the audio jacks into the top board. Solder only the middle pin for now.

Soldering only the middle pin keeps things flexible so you can make sure the jacks are flush with the board.

## 12. Get the PJ 301 jacks

This is what they look like before you snip off the excess metal jacket casing.

## 13. Snip the excess metal jacket casing off the jacks

You'll want the metal casing to be flush with the plastic part of the jack.

## 14. If needed, remove one of the ground pins from one of the jacks

![](./img/DSC_0049_Cropped.jpg)

You may find that the jacks fit better on the board if you remove one of their ground pins. Each jack has two ground pins, so removing one shouldn't cause any issues.

## 15. Insert the PJ 301 jacks, but do not solder them yet

## 16. Insert all of the LEDs, but do not solder them yet

You can use different color LEDs if you want, but the resistor values for each LED are calibrated for the original colors.

## 17. Put the front panel on

![](./img/DSC_0056_Cropped.jpg)

You only need to use three washers and nuts to secure the panel for now. The goal is to make sure the LEDs are flush with the panel.

## 18. Hold the module panel-side down so the LEDs lie flush with the panel

![](./img/DSC_0057_Cropped.jpg)

Lift the module up with the panel facing down, so that the LEDs are pulled flush to the panel. You may need to wiggle them around a bit.

## 19. Position the module panel-side down and solder jacks and LEDs

## 20. Trim the LED legs

## Snap the board together and screw on the remaining washers and nuts
