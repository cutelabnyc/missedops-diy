# Missed Ops DIY Kit Instructions

Hi and thanks for buying the Missed Ops DIY kit. Here's how you build it.

## 1. Get the base board and the pin sockets

The base board is the one with Missed Opportunities written on it.

## 2. Start by soldering the two outer pin sockets (J18 and J22)

The plastic on the socket should be the same side as the white outline around the pads. This is true for all the pin headers and sockets.

You only need to solder one pin on each for now, to hold everything in place.

## 3. Solder the four inner pin sockets (J19, J20, J21, J23)

Again, for now you only need to solder the inner pins. Make sure the plastic of the sockets is flush with the PCB.

## 4. Put the seven 3-pin headers into the pin sockets

Make sure to insert the longer side of the header, so the shorter side sticks out.

## 5. Align the top board, and slide the board onto the pins (J12, J13, J14, J15, J16)

## 6. Solder the pin you've just inserted through the top board, then solder the remaining pins on the bottom board

## 7. Separate the boards, gently pulling from both sides

## 8. Insert the 10k trimmer potentiometer and solder it in place (RV1)

## 9. Solder the 2x5 power header (J26) and the 3-pin header for the random generator's jumper (J11)

## 10. (Optional) Solder two 3-pin headers to create a 6-pin ISP header (J24)

The Atmega on your board comes preprogrammed, so you only need these pins if you want to upload your own firmware.

## 11. Insert the PJ-398 (Thonkiconn) jacks into the top board, soldering only the middle pin on each (J1, J2, J3, J4, J5, J6, J7, J8)

Soldering only the middle pin keeps things flexible so you can make sure the jacks are flush with the board.

## 12. Take the PJ-301 jacks, and snip the excess metal jacket casing off the jacks

This is what they look like before you snip off the excess metal jacket casing.

You'll want the metal casing to be flush with the plastic part of the jack. Otherwise, the jack will sit too high on the PCB.

## 13. If needed, remove one of the ground pins from one of the jacks

Because the two PJ-301 jacks are so close together, they share a pad. Fitting pins on both into that pad can be difficult, so you can remove one of the ground pins to make it fit more easily. Each jack has two ground pins, so removing one won't cause any issues.

## 14. Insert the PJ 301 jacks, **but do not solder them yet** (J9, J10)

## 15. Insert all of the LEDs, **but do not solder them yet** (D2-D11)

## 16. Insert the toggle switch, **but do not solder them yet** (SW2)

You can use different color LEDs if you want, but the resistor values for each LED are calibrated for the original colors.

## 17. Put the front panel on

![](./img/DSC_0056_Cropped.jpg)

You only need to use three nuts to secure the panel for now. The goal is to make sure the LEDs are flush with the panel.

## 18. Hold the module panel-side down so the LEDs lie flush with the panel

![](./img/DSC_0057_Cropped.jpg)

Lift the module up with the panel facing down, so that the LEDs are pulled flush to the panel. You may need to wiggle them around a bit.

## 19. Position the module panel-side down and solder jacks and LEDs

## 20. Trim the LED leads

## Snap the board together and screw on the remaining washers and nuts
